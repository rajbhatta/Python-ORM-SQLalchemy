"""
- We no longer need to import the Table class, but instead we import declarative_base and sessionmaker. 
- Instead of creating tables, we'll create Python classes that subclass declarative_base, and instead of making a connection to our database we'll ask for a session. 
- Both of these concepts are a higher layer of abstraction than the ones we used previously.
- As before we still create a database engine, and now we also instantiate a declarative_base. 
- Instead of defining our Employee class as a Table, we create a normal Python object which subclasses base and which defines __tablename__. 
- As before, we define the columns and column types for our Film object, but now we can use the attributes title, director, and year, instead of using the strings that we had before.
